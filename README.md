# EmojiSearch
To use: (works in Portrait mode only)
the prompt will ask you to choose an emoji, and it will display output on the screen for you. You have two options to get to your choice:
 (1) by choosing directly from the bottom view displaying round buttons with emojis in them. You can scroll through this view, click-hold and drag, to see more emojis. (20 in total)
 (2) if you cannot find the one you'd like to use, click on the button titled "Find emoji by group", which will open a drop down menu. This will narrow your selections to a specific emotion, and then you can choose from the output displayed in the scroll view below.
You only need to click on the round emoji button once for output to display. The output displays in a popup view, and can only be closed  by selecting the 'go back' button in the popup. If you decide on an emoji from a different group, you can either re open the drop down menu to select a different group, or select the "show all" button to re display all emoji buttons. Quotes are randomized, so you can click the same emoji smiley twice and it may display two different quotes, though they are specific to the group the emoji falls under.
